A couple of things that I am currently up to: 
 - :computer: Currently focused on web development with NextJS and improving my JS expertise
 - :art: Currently focused on front-end Development but I am interested in back-end Development, with a sprinkle of database management
 - 🌱 Trying to better my current skills
    - [ improve problem-solving skills, understand expressJS better, learn to manage data more efficiently]
 - :thinking: Having fun to figuring out _JaVaScRiPt_ 
 - :godmode: Currently working through the Odin Project - The JavaScript Focus
 - 🍽️ Using FreeCodeCamp to strengthen my basics
